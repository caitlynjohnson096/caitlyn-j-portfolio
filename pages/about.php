       <div class="about-writing">
       <p> <b>Hi, I'm Caitlyn,</b></p>
          <p> and I am a junior studying Information Science with a concentration in User Experience Design at Cornell University. I became passionate about UX design through a variety of my courses at school that discuss the importance of making design clear, understandable, and accessible. I have begun divining into this interest through my Design Consulting Club. This experience has allowed me to gain real-life UX experience and work with clients to create specialized technology solutions that meet a specific user's needs. Through this opportunity, I have been able to design a product for the Stanford Longevity Design Challenge and I have begun working with a client on a project in the financial sector. </p>

          <p>Moreover, I have been working on the design side of a web-startup called SciQuel. SciQuel's goal is to create science more accessible and easier to understand in order to spread truthful scientific information. My work for them has involved using Figma to design features of their web-app as well as conducting user experience research. I also have an interest in learning the more technical side of design. I have been exploring my interest in coding through a variety of college offered courses. I have some basic experience in both Python and Java.</p>
