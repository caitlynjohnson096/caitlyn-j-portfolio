<p><strong>Overview</strong>
A project completed for The Stanford Longevity Design Challenge with a team of students from Design Consulting at Cornell. We designed a gardening app to encourage urban dwellers interact with their physical environment.   </P>

<h2> Problem </h2>
<p>How can we motivate  and educate urban dwellers on gardening so that they are able to interact with their physical space thus promoting a healthier lifestyle? </p>

<h2> Solution </h2>
<p>
A gardening app that aims to motivate  and provide knowledge to urban dwellers who are attempting to garden . The app utilizes daily to-dos, check-ins, plant growing in a virtual space, and personalized plant kits to help bridge knowledge gaps and motivate the user to grow a plant successfully.</p>

<h2> User Research </h2>
<div class="three-column">
  <div class="columns1">
    <h3>Survey</h3>
    <p>A survey gauging interest and pain points was sent out across various internet platforms, such as Facebook and Reddit.</p>
</diV>
<div class="columns2">
  <h3> User Interviews</h3>
  <p>
Interviews were conducted to better understand how people interact with their environment and how gardening may change that
</p>
</div>
<div class="columns3">
<h3>Synthesis</h3>
<p>Our findings were sorted into an affinity diagram to categorize user interests and needs.</p>
</div>
</div>

<h3> Survey Findings </h3>

<p>From the survey we were able to conclude that 94% of our participants had a high interest in attempting to garden or had gardened in the past. Additionally, we were able to conclude that 39.9% of participants ranked time as one of their top pain points with space and lack of knowledge making up 23% and 16.9% of participants respectively. </p>

<h3> User Interviews </h2>
<div class="two-colum">
  <div class="column1">
    <p><strong>
Who are the interviewees:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Those who live in urban/suburban areas</li>
  <li>Those with gardening experience</li>
  <li>Those who may not have had the opportunity to garden</li>
</ul>

</div>
<div class="column2">
  <p><strong>
What are the goals of the interviews:</strong> </p>
<ul>
  <li>Understand how urban/suburban lifestyles affect well-being</li>
  <li>Understand how gardening can affect well-being</li>
  <li>Determine why those interested in gardening have not started </li>
</ul>

</div>

</div>

<h3> Synthesis</h3>
<p>
From the findings from the survey we generated an affinity diagram by grouping user information in several different iterations.Then these categories were recategorized into positive and negative groups.  </p>

<h3> Key Findings </h3>

<h1> Reflection </h1>
<p>This project helped me learn some technical UX skills and exposed me to software like Figma and whimsical. Prior to this project, I has no experience working in high-fi or prototyping and I has the opportunity to experiment with both during this project. </p>
