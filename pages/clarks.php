    <h1> Clarks Auto-body Repair Website Redesign</h1>

    <h2> Overview</h2>

      <p> This was a group project that I completed for Introductorary Design and Programming
      for the Web. In this project, I had to find a client that needed their website redesigned. We
      decided to work with clarks as their current website was incomplete, had javascript issues, and
      overall was not the most user-friendly site.</p>

      <p>After taking on the client, the task was to create a user-centered website that was designed
      by conducting interviews, contacting the client, generating sketches, user testing, and redesigning.
      This process ensured that the website would be designed with inteded audience in mind</p>

      <p> <em> Note: The website is not up and running yet, but has been completed</em></p>

    <div class="grey-section">
        <h2> User Research </h2>

          <p> Several user-interviews were conducted to learn more about how a user goes about finding autobody work, so that there was a better understaning of the user's needs and how we could meet those </P>
          <p> Here is a sample interview conducted for this project </p>

          <div class=interviews>

              <img  src="public/images/interview.PNG" alt="interview image">
          </div>

          <p> After conducting several interviewees, we found that a lot of them had loyalty to one autobody reapir shop,   and tended to stay with peoople that they already trusted. This meant it was likely that a very niche group of people would be accessesing the site in the first place. We also discovered be interviewing several customers of the shop how much they value the owner's relationship to his customers as well as his honesty and repair work</P>

    </div>

    <h2> Synthesis </h2>
        <p> From the user research we were able to generate several goals for the site </p>
        <ol>
          <li> Use design elements to emphasize what makes their service better and more personal because it is a small business </li>
          <li> Update website information and make it well-organized  so that the audience can locate important information easily </li>
          <li> Use customer testimonials in strategic ways</li>
          <li> Use media queries to improve the mobile version of the site for greater accessibility </li>
        </ol>

    <div class="grey-section">
      <h2> Content Planning and Organization </h2>

        <p> During this phase of design it was decided what sort of content would be inccoperated into our website design then from there
            we did five card sortings to combine this contnent into four well organized website tabs. </p>

        <div class="card-sorting">
          <!-- Source: (original work)  caityn johnson -->
          <img  src="public/images/card4.jpg" alt="card sorting">
        </div>

        <p> From here we named our four web pages </p>
            <ol>
              <li> Home </li>
              <li> Auto-body Repairs </li>
              <li> Warranties and your rights </li>
              <li> About Us </li>
            </ol>

            <h3> Visual Theme </h3>

              <p> Next we considered various visual themes for our site. Our first idea was to use a red and black theme to generate a sleek look for the website, and in this design a majority of the "white space" would be black. We also were considering a theme that was blue, black, and white to differentiate this auto-body site from one that currently exist on the internet, which would possibly allow the site to stick out. However, we ended up deciding to go with a black and red theme on a white background. This theme would also include easily readable font, as well as, decorative images of the team working to engage the users and build their trust in the shop</p>

    </div>

    <h2> Sketches </h2>

      <p> Once we had chosen a visual theme we began to sketch our webpages. We iterated through several sketches, but below are our final sketches
                  from each of the four pages (before user testing was conducted)</p>

      <h2> User Testing </h2>

        <p> Once we implemented our skteches, we then began the user testing process where we would gauge the ease of use and accessibility of our site by testing it on potential users. </p>

        <p> When the user testing was completed we decided to implement several changes to the design based on feedback from our users</P>

        <p>As a result of the user testing the "Autobody Repair" page will need to alter the background of the site when the certifications are clicked, so that the user can notice the changes in the site (the "pop-up") more easily. Look Below to see the redesign </p>

        <div class="sketches">
            <!-- Source: (original work) caityn johnson -->
            <img class="sketch1"  src="public/images/cert-inter-redesign.jpg" alt="cert redesign">
        </div>


        <p>Another change that will be implemented is ensuring that the site is overall accessible especially when it comes to interactivity. After watching users complete the user-tests, it became apparent that we were missing cursors or changes in buttons to show the user that they can click there. While, working on this design we will add this signifiers to indicate to users where they can click as well as aria-labels for a screen-reader.</p>

        <p>We also decided to rename the "Autobody repair" navigation tab because users were having trouble finding the certifications. We decided to name it "Autobody work & certifications". This way the user would get a better sense for what was on the page.</p>

        <p> We also decided to change the about us page to include an image that gives more information about what clarks is about. After our first user test, it was determined that some people had trouble identifying how clark is involved in the community, so we decided to add an image from Avya's ride on the site. This also caused the site to need to be redesigned especially in the desktop version to ensure that the image fit on the page well. See the redesign below </p>

        <h2> Key Takeaways </h2>

          <p> After finishing this project some of the key takeaways are learning to implement interactivity that improves the user experience. In this project, the reviews section that had interactivity added to it as a view more/less button was not well-designed as it did not improve the user experience. The goal of this interactivity was to decrease the amount of scrolling that a user had to do. This is because the reviews took up a lot of space on the page and were quite repetitive; however, by shorening each indivual review the overall going of deceasing respitivness, and the amount of space that these reviews took up was lost. Therefore, for future project it is important to keep in mind when using javascript that the design of the   page we are implementing musst benefit the user in some way. </p>
